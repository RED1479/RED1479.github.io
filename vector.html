     Working with vector is exciting. Somehow, to me, vectors represent endless possibilities. Literally and Metaphorically. The vector section is where the character, a 7-year-old boy, Reason Lukig, goes to the moon where he discovers COLD. The Dark Forest, is part childâ€™s fantasy and horror, as we find in Reason who is mourning the death of his mother whom he believes ended up close to the moon after her death.
