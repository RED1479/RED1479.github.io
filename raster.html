     The Raster assignment for VMD 105 is to produce a selfie. As a person new to photo editing I find the assignment challenging, but I give myself some room to be creative with hues and masking. The final image is of me. In the photo I represent a prisoner captured by COLD. COLD members use their light powers to take over every cell of my body. My skin is changing, and a COLD leader, queen LUX is pleased and watches from a monitor in her space ship before she turns her back toward the screen.
